##Course summary

STAT 450 and 460 are courses in mathematical statistics intended for upper-level undergraduate students in the mathematical sciences. The goal in STAT 450 is provide a solid foundation in the theory of random variables, probability distributions, and convergence in probability and distribution. The successful student in STAT 460 will leave the course with a basic understanding of many of the important foundational concepts in statistical inference, namely estimation (with confidence) and hypothesis testing. In addition, students will be comfortable using a wide variety of mathematical tools for solving statistical inference problems. 

Along the way, students will also become adept at using R to investigate and solve statistical problems.  

## Course text

The required text for this course is Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, & Scheaffer (7th Ed.)  Students may share copies of this book, although students planning on continuing to graduate school are encouraged to have their own copy.

##  Statistical computing

We will use the open-source R programming language extensively throughout this course, both in the course notes and through regular R-specific assignments.  Some R-related resources are below.  If you have no experience with R (or even if you do), I highly recommend you look at some of the below tutorials.  Those who have some experience in R are recommended to jump straight to the tutorial on loops and if/else statements, as this kind of coding logic will be prevalent in this course.  

  * <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/> Base R  </a> 
  * <a href=https://www.rstudio.com/home/>  R Studio </a> 
  * <a href=http://tryr.codeschool.com/levels/1/challenges/1>  Interactive introduction to basic R </a> 
  * <a href=http://scc.stat.ucla.edu/page_attachments/0000/0093/Intermediate_R_2_09S.pdf> Nice powerpoint on loops and if/else statements </a> 
  * <a href=https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf> ggplot2 cheat sheet </a> (I use this ALL THE TIME)
