##Course summary

STAT 450 and 460 are courses in mathematical statistics intended for upper-level undergraduate students in the mathematical sciences. The goal in STAT 450 is provide a solid foundation in the theory of random variables, probability distributions, and convergence in probability and distribution. The successful student in STAT 460 will leave the course with a basic understanding of many of the important foundational concepts in statistical inference, namely estimation (with confidence) and hypothesis testing. In addition, students will be comfortable using a wide variety of mathematical tools for solving statistical inference problems. 

Along the way, students will also become adept at using R to investigate and solve statistical problems.  

## Course text

The required text for this course is Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, & Scheaffer (7th Ed.)  Students may share copies of this book, although students planning on continuing to graduate school are encouraged to have their own copy.
